## Learning Objectives

- Import custom image detection data using **Roboflow**
- Set up the YOLOv3-tiny model in **Keras**
- Train the YOLOv3-tiny model
- Perform inference using the trained model
- Save Keras model weights for future quantization and FPGA compilation

## Data Management with Roboflow

[Roboflow](https://roboflow.ai) is a tool optimized for managing, preprocessing, augmenting, and versioning computer vision datasets.

**Key Benefits:**
- 50% reduction in coding effort
- Automatic annotation quality verification
- Shorter training times
- Enhanced model reproducibility
